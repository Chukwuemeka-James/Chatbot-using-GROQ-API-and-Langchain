# Project Overview - Chatbot using Groq API and LangChain

This project demonstrates the creation of a chatbot utilizing Groq technology and LangChain for conversational systems. The primary goals are to effectively manage dialogues and develop a responsive AI assistant. This chatbot is built on the Groq API using the Gemma2-9b-It model.

## Features
- **Session-Based Memory**: The model can handle multiple chat sessions and remember user-specific information across different chats.
- **Dynamic Language Support**: Allows language switching (e.g., English, French) for responses.
- **Prompt Customization**: Customizable prompts for different contexts.
- **Message Trimming**: Efficiently manages large conversation histories using `trim_messages`.


## Potential Applications

- **Research & Academia**: This project can serve as a tool for researchers and students, showcasing advanced AI techniques in natural language processing and memory management in chatbot systems.
- **Customer Support Systems**: The chatbot's ability to maintain conversation history and adapt to various language needs makes it ideal for real-time customer service applications.
- **Multilingual Assistants**: With its language adaptability and dynamic response system, this chatbot can act as a virtual assistant for global markets.
- **AI-driven Educational Tools**: The project could be extended into interactive AI tutors, providing real-time feedback and maintaining session histories across multiple learning sessions.

## Conclusion

This chatbot project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of applying state-of-the-art AI technologies for building a conversational agent.
